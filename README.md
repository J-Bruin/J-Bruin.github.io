**Hi class, welcome to the AOS C111/204 final project!** <img align="right" width="220" height="220" src="/assets/IMG/template_logo.png">

For this project, you will be applying your skills to train a machine learning model using real-world data, then publishing a report on your own website.

* To get data for your project, you could:
  * use **your own data** from a separate research activity
  * **scour the internet** to find something original, then preprocess it yourself - see the Module Overview on BruinLearn for some resources
  * browse an archive of data designed for machine learning problems, such as the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets)

* Your report should be in the region of 2000-2500 words with three to four figures, and written in a scientific language and style. [This template page](/project.md) gives an example structure that you could use, but feel free to make it your own.

Your website will be a great addition to your CV, and a place to host future projects too since it doubles as a GitHub repository. The first step is to set up a project website like this one by following the instructions below.

## Guide to Adding Content
* Your repository's `README.md` file (the file you are reading now) acts like a home page. Replace its contents with whatever you want the world to see by editing the file on GitHub.
* If you want to turn this page into a CV or blog, etc., it may be useful to refer to a [guide for writing Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
* You can create other markdown files (.md) in your repository and navigate to them from this page using links, i.e.: [here is a link to another file, `project.md`](project.md)
* When editing a markdown file on GitHub, it is useful to wrap text by selecting the *Soft wrap* option as shown: ![screenshot](/assets/IMG/instr_wrap.png)
* If you want to get even more technical, you can also write HTML in your .md files, and GitHub Pages will render it. For example, the image below is displayed by writing the following (edit this file to see!): `<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="/assets/IMG/template_frog.png">`

## Delivering your Project

Your final project is delivered in two components: a report and your code.

### Report

My report: [Right here.](/assets/Final Project - Justin Casillas.pdf) https://github.com/J-Bruin/J-Bruin.github.io/blob/main/assets/Final%20Project%20-%20Justin%20Casillas.pdf

Your report should be **delivered via your website**. Submit a link to your website on BruinLearn so that your instructor can browse it to find your report. 

To make this simple, you can write the report using a word processor or Latex, then export it as a .pdf file and upload it to the `assets` directory. You can then link to it [like so](/assets/project_demo.pdf). However, you can also type the report directly onto the website using another markdown page - [here is](/project.md) a template for that.

### Code

My code: [Right here.](/assets/Final_Project.ipynb) https://github.com/J-Bruin/J-Bruin.github.io/blob/main/assets/Final_Project.ipynb

A link to your code must be submitted on BruinLearn, and the course instructor must be able to download your code to mark it. The code could be in a Google Colab notebook (make sure to *share* the notebook so access is set to **Anyone with the link**), or you could upload the code into a separate GitHub repository, or you could upload the code into the `assets` directory of your website and link to it.
